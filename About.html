                <h3>My name is Christy Inthoulay and I am a student currently attending high-school. I created this website  because I wanted to share my art to others, since it is a way I express myself. <br>
                  <br>As an Asian-American I also would like to share my life struggles through art to show hardships of being Asian in America. Another reason I made this website is to share my culture because I am Laotian and many don't even know that Laos exists! <br>
                   <br>It is my first time creating a website, but I hoped you enjoyed your stay at Chrisy's Cafe! </h3>

              <h1>Q&A</h1> 
             

              <p><strong>Do you want to become a professional artist in the future?</strong></p>
              
              <p>I would have to be really skilled to be considered a professional artist and it would take a lot of work to get there.
                At the moment, I think that art will stay as a hobby because I'm not skilled enought to have art as a career.
              </p>

              <br>

              <p><strong>Do you like any games?</strong></p>
              <p>My favorite games are Roblox and Minecraft! (Roblox is technically a website but it's a website with games on it so idc :p) </p>

              <br>

              <p><strong>Do you enjoy coding?</strong></p>
              <p>I think coding is pretty cool but it is a lot of work when you're new to it and can be confusing at times.</p>
              <br>

              <p><strong>How long have you been drawing?</strong></p>
              <p>I've been drawing since I was a little kid, I remember it all started as stick figures and then I eventually developed my own art style. 
                I started to take art seriously during middle school, but I lost motivation and stopped drawing for two years. I got back into art in highschool because I got bored during quarantine....</p>
                <br>      

            

              <p><strong>Do you like coffee?</strong></p>
          <p>The whole theme of this website is a cafe, so you would assume that the creator would like coffee, but I actually hate coffee. 
            The only coffee I would accept is a sweet iced coffee, but that's it! I remember when I was younger I took a sip of my dad's coffee
            and it was really bitter, which was disgusting.
